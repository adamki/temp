#### What does this do?
A small React web application that interfaces with https://jobcoin.gemini.com/tables/api

#### Instructions for reviewer:
* yarn install
* yarn start

The App should now be running @ localhost:3000

* "Sign in" with address `adam`
* User can now conduct jobcoin transactions. I've been using `bob` as a recipient.
* sending an amount too high returns an error.
